# Data Analytics & Automation Project Guide

This guide describes the full workflow for the **Smart-Warehouse-Management-System** data analytics and automation project, aligned to a Warehouse & Transport Data Analyst role in logistics.[web:10][web:26]

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project demonstrates the core competencies required for a Warehouse & Transport Data Analyst at Uniserve or similar logistics organisations.[web:10][web:25] It focuses on data cleaning, automation, Power BI reporting, SQL querying, and warehouse/transport operations analysis using a realistic, messy dataset.

### Objectives

- Transform messy, real-world warehouse data into clean, structured datasets.
- Build automated Power BI dashboards for operational decision-making.
- Develop SQL queries and ETL processes for data transformation.
- Identify opportunities for process improvement and automation.
- Demonstrate understanding of inventory management, stock control, and vehicle routing.[web:10][web:26]

---

## 2. Dataset Overview

The project uses a warehouse management dataset with intentional data quality issues to simulate real-world challenges.[web:10][web:26] It contains **8,650 records** across four key operational areas:

| Dataset   | Records | Description                                                                                  |
|-----------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inventory | 5,000   | Stock levels, SKUs, warehouse locations, reorder points, supplier information               |
| Orders    | 3,000   | Customer orders, delivery dates, pricing, status tracking, shipping addresses               |
| Transport | 500     | Vehicle routing, driver assignments, delivery performance, fuel consumption                 |
| Suppliers | 150     | Supplier performance, delivery metrics, payment terms, contact information                  |

---

## 3. Data Quality Challenges

The dataset includes realistic issues that require cleaning, standardisation, and validation.[web:20][web:26]

### 3.1 Format Inconsistencies

- Date formats: `YYYY-MM-DD`, `DD/MM/YYYY`, `DD-MM-YYYY`, `YYYY/MM/DD`.
- Location codes: `A1-2-3` vs `Aisle1/Bay2/Shelf3` vs `A1.2.3`.
- Warehouse names: `London DC` vs `LONDON DC` vs `London`.
- Order IDs: `ORD-`, `ORDER`, `O` prefixes.
- Status fields: mixed case and variants (`Pending`, `PENDING`, `pending`).

### 3.2 Missing Data

- 8% missing unit costs in inventory.
- 10% missing stock check dates.
- 5% missing customer names in orders.
- 15% missing delivery dates.
- 8% missing driver names in transport data.

### 3.3 Data Errors

- 5% negative stock quantities (system/input errors).
- ~200 duplicate SKUs simulating manual entry errors.
- 15% orphaned orders where SKUs are not in inventory.
- 5% delivery dates earlier than order dates.
- Vehicle overloading where load exceeds capacity.[web:26]

### 3.4 Inconsistent Calculations

- 30% of orders have inconsistent `Total_Value` vs `Unit_Price × Quantity`.
- 10% have null `Total_Value` despite populated unit prices.

- Detect and correct negative stock quantities.

### Phase 2: Data Validation & Quality Rules

- Create validation rules to flag:
  - Negative stock.
  - Overloaded vehicles.
  - Orphaned orders.
  - Date inconsistencies (delivery before order).

## 13. Additional Resources

### 13.1 Useful SQL Patterns

```sql
-- Find duplicate SKUs
SELECT SKU, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM Inventory
GROUP BY SKU
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Calculate stock turnover (simplified example)
SELECT 
    i.Category,
    SUM(o.Quantity_Ordered) / NULLIF(AVG(i.Quantity_On_Hand), 0) AS Turnover_Ratio
FROM Inventory i
JOIN Orders o ON i.SKU = o.SKU
GROUP BY i.Category;

-- Items below reorder point
SELECT SKU, Product_Name, Quantity_On_Hand, Reorder_Point
FROM Inventory
WHERE Quantity_On_Hand < Reorder_Point;

-- Vehicle utilisation analysis
SELECT 
    Vehicle_ID,
    AVG(Current_Load_KG / NULLIF(Capacity_KG, 0) * 100.0) AS Utilisation_Pct
FROM Transport
GROUP BY Vehicle_ID;

### 13.2 Power BI DAX Measures
text
-- Stock Out Rate
Stock Out Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Inventory, Inventory[Quantity_On_Hand] = 0)),
    COUNTROWS(Inventory)
)

-- On-Time Delivery %
On-Time Delivery % = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Orders, Orders[Delivery_Date] <= Orders[Expected_Date])),
    COUNTROWS(Orders)
)

-- Average Order Value
Average Order Value = 
AVERAGE(Orders[Total_Value])

## 14. Tips for Success
Start simple: prioritise basic data cleaning before advanced analytics.[web:22]

Document everything: keep a log of cleaning rules, assumptions, and decisions.[web:21][web:24]

Validate often: test queries and measures at each stage to catch errors early.

Think business-first: frame findings in terms of operational and financial impact.[web:25]

Use version control: track changes to SQL, Python, and Power BI files in Git.

Create reusable components: parameterised queries, modular scripts, reusable DAX.

Test edge cases: handle nulls, duplicates, outliers, and unexpected formats.

Seek feedback: share dashboards for usability and interpretability reviews.[web:24]
